# SeafClient

This project is a client implementation for the [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com) Web API  for .Net as portable class library (PCL).
It can be used in desktop apps, Windows Universal Platform Projects (UWP), Windows Store applications as well as in apps for Windows Phone 7.5+, 8.x and on Windows 10 Mobile.

The aim is to create a library to easily access a Seafile server and the files stored there through a .Net application in a strong-typed fashion (no custom JSON parsing and with meaningful error messages, etc.) The library uses async/await methods for requests to the Seafile server.

The current stable release of the SeafClient library is available on NuGet [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SeafClient/).

This repository is automatically built and tested with AppVeyor: <br/>

## Usage example (C#)

```C#
using SeafClient;

async Task Demo()
{
    var serverUri = new Uri("https://seacloud.cc", UriKind.Absolute);
    var username = "testuser@internet.com";
    var password = new [] { 't', 'e', 's', 't' };

    try
    {
        // authenticate with the Seafile server and retrieve a Session
        var session = await SeafSession.Establish(serverUri, username, password);

        // connection was successful
        // The password array has been overwritten with zeroes as soon as the authentication request was sent
        // now retrieve some information about the account
        var accountInfo = await session.CheckAccountInfo();
        Debug.WriteLine("Nickname: {0}\nUsed Storage: {1:d} Bytes\nQuota: {2}", accountInfo.Nickname, accountInfo.Usage, accountInfo.Usage);

        // get the url of the user avatar
        var userAvatar = await session.GetUserAvatar(128);
        Debug.WriteLine("Url to user's avatar: " + userAvatar.Url);

        // get the libraries
        var libraries = await session.ListLibraries();
        foreach (var lib in libraries)
            Debug.WriteLine(lib.Name + " " + lib.Timestamp);

        // list root contents of the first library
        var firstLib = libraries.FirstOrDefault();
        if (firstLib != null)
        {
            var content = await session.ListDirectory(firstLib, "/");
            foreach (var dirEntry in content)
                switch (dirEntry.Type)
                {
                    case SeafClient.Types.DirEntryType.File:
                        Debug.WriteLine(dirEntry.Name + " - " + dirEntry.Size + " Bytes");
                        break;
                    default:
                        Debug.WriteLine(dirEntry.Name);
                        break;
                }
        }
    }
    catch (SeafException ex)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine($"An error occured: {ex.Message} (ErrorCode: {ex.SeafError.SeafErrorCode} ({ex.SeafError.HttpStatusCode}))");
    }
}
```

* Get Server Info
* Check Account Info
* Get User Avatar
* Get Default Library
* Get Library Info
* Create Library (unencrypted and encrypted)
* List Libraries / List Shared Libraries
* List Directory Entries
* Create Directory
* Delete Directory / File

* Copy / Move File
* Get Thumbnail Image
* Get Download Link
* Get Upload Link / Upload file
* Get Update link / Update file
* Starred files (list / star / unstar)
* Groups (list / create / delete)
* Group members (add / bulk add / remove)
